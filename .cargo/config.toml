# Disable FMA contraction to ensure byte-exact compatibility with JS floating-point.
# LLVM may emit fused multiply-add instructions that combine multiply+add with a single
# rounding step. The colorDelta function has dense multiply-accumulate chains where a
# 1-ULP FMA difference propagates through y*y and can flip threshold comparisons.
